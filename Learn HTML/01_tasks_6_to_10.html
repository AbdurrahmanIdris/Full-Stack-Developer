<!-- Task #2 -->
No There is no different because the attribute value can be double quoted or single quoted
And if the value consists of one word = it can be put without any quotes.
Example:
<p class="element">Welcome To The New World</p>
<p class='element'>Welcome To The New World</p>
<p class=element>Welcome To The New World</p>
<br>
<!-- Task #3 -->
No there is no different. <br>
In first line of code, attribute value is used without quotes so hiddent is treated as an attribute. <br>

<p class=element hidden>Welcome To The New World</p>
<p class="element" hidden>Welcome To The New World</p>
<br>
